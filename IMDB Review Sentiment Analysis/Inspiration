This was my introduction to sentiment analysis and in turn Natural Language Processing.
This project was a part of my Machine Learning nanodegree at Udacity.
The main idea was to learn AWS cloud functionality.
I got to learn everything about how Amazon Sagemaker and Lambda functions and how a deployed model can be fixed if input data is modified.
